# React

## Basics

- Component based
- Declarative paradigm

##### Wrapper

You can create a component that works as a template for other things. In the example, the component Card is a wrapper for the blocks of both Expenses component and ExpenseItem components

#### UseState

This React function enables the developer to create two key features:

`const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)`

Where the state is the variable it is desired to store and setState is the function used to modify that variable. It is important to know that this function can be used (preferably this way) with the `prevState` argument, giving the developer the value of the state prior to the change. This is important since React can "misplace" the track of the states on how they are changing if they are related among them and could lead to bugs.
